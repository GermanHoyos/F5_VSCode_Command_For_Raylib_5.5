## âœ… Changes Made to Support C++:

1. **Updated compiler & standards**  
   - Changed to `g++` / `clang++` and set `-std=c++17`  
   - Ensures proper C++ compilation instead of C.

2. **VSCode IntelliSense updates**  
   - Updated `c_cpp_properties.json` with Raylib headers and C++ standard  
   - Fixed include paths for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

3. **Tasks & Launch configuration**  
   - Updated `tasks.json` for `build debug` & `build release` using C++  
   - Fixed `launch.json` to run the compiled `.exe` / binary without `PickExeExtension` error.

4. **Makefile adjustments**  
   - Ensured `main.cpp` compiles as C++  
   - Set proper compiler flags for desktop platforms

5. **Project cleanup for GitHub**  
   - Added `.gitignore` to exclude `.exe`, `.o`, and build artifacts  
   - Focused repo on **VSCode project files**, `main.cpp`, and `resources`
